# Shabbat Robot Application

## Overview

"Shabbat Robot" is a web application designed to help observant Jewish users manage their social media presence during Shabbat. The application provides automated content hiding and restoration functionality for various social media platforms (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok) based on Shabbat times.

The application follows Jewish religious principles by automatically hiding social media content before Shabbat begins and restoring it after Shabbat ends, allowing users to maintain their digital presence while respecting religious observances.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Language Support**: Hebrew (RTL) with English fallback

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with persistent storage
- **Development**: Hot reloading with Vite middleware integration

### Database Design
- **ORM**: Drizzle with PostgreSQL adapter
- **Migration System**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations
- **Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- User registration and login with password hashing
- Session persistence with configurable expiry
- User account types: free, youtube_pro, premium

### Platform Integration Services
- **Facebook Integration**: OAuth 2.0 with Graph API v22.0
- **YouTube Integration**: Google OAuth with YouTube Data API v3
- **Instagram Integration**: Planned through Facebook Business API
- **TikTok Integration**: Planned with TikTok Developer API

### Content Management
- Automated content hiding/showing based on Shabbat times

- User-configurable exception lists for content
- Operation history tracking and audit logs

### User Interface Components
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Accessibility features for RTL languages
- Real-time status updates and notifications
- Multi-platform dashboard with unified controls

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers/logs in through secure form
2. Server validates credentials and generates JWT token
3. Token stored in localStorage with automatic expiry handling
4. Middleware validates token on protected routes

### Platform Connection Flow
1. User initiates OAuth flow for specific platform
2. Redirect to platform's authorization server
3. Platform returns authorization code
4. Server exchanges code for access/refresh tokens
5. Tokens stored securely with expiration tracking

### Content Management Flow
1. System calculates Shabbat times based on user location/timezone
2. Scheduler monitors time and triggers content operations
3. Platform APIs called to modify content privacy status
4. Operations logged with success/failure status
5. User notified of operation results

### Data Synchronization
- Real-time updates using TanStack Query
- Optimistic updates for better user experience
- Error handling with automatic retry mechanisms
- Background sync for token refresh operations

## External Dependencies
